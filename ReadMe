To run the application just run the script video-gen.sh

To modify the colors of the images modify the values in the function:
    PngImageWriter.cpp => setPixelValues
This function works as follows:
    value = iterations made for that pixel
    max_iter = maximum number of iterations for that pixel
    pixel = (R, G, B) pixel

    Modify (R, G, B) values from the iterations number made for that pixel.


For the application to work you will need to install the following packages:
    sudo apt-get install libpng*
    sudo apt-get install imageMagick

Be sure to use gcc-4.7 and g++-4.7 -
